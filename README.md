## About Flash Cards

Flash cards have long been recognized as an excellent tool for memorization and learning. The concept is simple: write a question or prompt on one side of a card, and the answer on the other. This method engages active recall, enabling the learner to strengthen neural connections and improve memory retention.

## Why Study Stacks?

You can now create, manage, and study your flash cards online, anytime, anywhere. Our platform also offers additional features like tracking your progress over time and organizing your cards into different stacks for better organization and focused learning.

## Technologies Used

Study Stacks is built with C# using the ASP.NET Core framework. Razor Pages, a feature of ASP.NET Core MVC, is used for creating a clean, functional user interface. Data persistence is handled with Entity Framework Core, which allows for easy data access and manipulation.
